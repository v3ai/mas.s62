# This is a home to Rhett's completed mas.s62 Psets.

You are welcome to see how I implemented each task
You are also welcome to see my notes/explanation/test files

All of those will be found in the rhettfiles directory

the main.go and other original files will have my work in them

If you are attempting to do the pset, please get a new set of files

you can do so by 

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-dci/mas.s62.git
```

in your term

DISCLAIMER

I just started learning go a month ago, so it will not be the best code
